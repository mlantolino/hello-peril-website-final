                Ali Wong and Randall Park’s highly-anticipated rom-com Always Be My Maybe arrived on Netflix
                on Friday, May 31 to acclaimed fanfare. The film follows two childhood friends, Sasha (Wong)
                and Marcus (Park), who reconnect after 15 years and rekindle their romance against the backdrop
                of San Francisco. With Sasha as a renowned chef expanding her restaurant empire and Marcus as
                a stagnant rapper still living at home. Through his role as Marcus, Park has charmed audiences with
                his rap proses as frontman of the film’s band, Hello Peril. Following the film’s release,
                Hello Peril’s songs are now streaming, and the Always Be My Maybe band has a pivotal connection
                to Asian history.

                With hilarious original tracks such as “Hello,” “Tennis Ball,” and “I Punched Keanu Reeves,"
                Hello Peril's songs are now available to stream on Spotify, Apple, and Amazon. Inspired by
                experiences with his own hip-hop group during the '90s, Park co-wrote the verses with veteran
                hip-hop producer Dan the Automator. The results are original tracks that explore gentrification,
                tennis balls, and, well, punching Keanu Reeves. But silliness aside, viewers were quick to piece
                together the significance behind Hello Peril’s moniker after the film’s release: Hello Peril
                serves as a word play on “Yellow Peril,” the 19th century term for anti-Asian fear in the West,
                which in turn led to the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. This, reportedly combined with everyone’s
                favorite Sanrio feline Hello Kitty, laid the groundwork for Hello Peril.
